# Tasks

* Write Ammer and Spain dataset
* Write learning objectives
* Which model type, p-adjustment and nrepet is used?

:::

This tutorial uses Bello et al. ([2021](https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108628426)) and Zelený ([2021](https://www.davidzeleny.net/anadat-r/doku.php/en:cwm_fc_examples#example_3ecological_interpretation_of_the_unconstrained_axes_in_constrained_ordination_using_mean_ellenberg-like_indicator_values))

A helpful textbook is 'Numerical Ecology' (Borcard et al. [2018](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-71404-2)) and 'Multivariate Analysis of Ecological Data with ade4' (Thioulouse et al. [2018](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-8850-1))

# Preparation

## Load libraries and functions

We need the `ade4` package of Dray & Dufour ([2007](https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v022.i04)) to use the fourth-corner approach of Legendre et al ([1997](https://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[0547:RBTHST]2.0.CO;2)) and Dray & Legendre ([2008](https://doi.org/10.1890/08-0349.1))

```{r libraries, message = FALSE}
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(ade4)
rm(list = ls())
```

## Load data

```{r load-data}
load(url('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zdealveindy/anadat-r/master/data/vltava.RData'))

species_vltava <- vltava$herbs$spe
sites_vltava <- vltava$env
traits_vltava <- vltava$herbs$traits %>%
  mutate(
    seed.weight_log = log(seed.weight),
    SLA_log = log(SLA)
    )

species_spain <- read_delim(
  here::here("data", "raw", "bello_etal-2021", "chapter5", "speciesXplotsNE.txt"),
  col_names = TRUE, delim = "\t", col_types = cols(.default = "?")
  )

traits_spain <- read_delim(
  here::here("data", "raw", "bello_etal-2021", "chapter5", "speciesXtraitsNE.txt"),
  col_names = TRUE, delim = "\t", col_types = cols(.default = "?")
  )

sites_spain <- read_csv(
  here::here("data", "processed", "data_processed_sites_spain_4.5.csv"),
  col_names = TRUE, col_types = cols(.default = "?")
  )

species_ammer <- read_csv(
  here::here("data", "processed", "data_processed_species_ammer_4.1.csv"),
  col_names = TRUE, col_types = cols(.default = "?")
  )

traits_ammer <- read_csv(
  here::here("data", "processed", "data_processed_traits_ammer_4.1.csv"),
  col_names = TRUE, col_types = cols(.default = "?")

# Fourth-corner approach (species level)

## Vltava dataset

This example directly follows the Vlatava example, in which we related CWM of SLA calculated from herb understory in the forest sites to canopy cover in the same sites as a proxy of the light available for the understory plants. We found a significant positive relationship, i.e. higher cover (less light) = higher SLA.

### Preparation

In this exercise, we will calculate the same relationship, but using the fourth corner method, introduced by Pierre Legendre and colleagues ([1997](https://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[0547:RBTHST]2.0.CO;2)). The method is implemented in the package `ade4`.

Remember to remove the missing species from both species composition and trait matrices, since the function `fourthcorner` cannot handle them. Also, `fourthcorner` function expects that all objects representing data will be data frames, so better to convert data into them right at the beginning.

```{r}
traits <- traits_vltava %>%
  select(SLA_log) %>%
  drop_na()

species <- species_vltava %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "plot.id") %>%
  pivot_longer(-plot.id, names_to = "name", values_to = "value") %>%
  semi_join(
    traits %>%
      rownames_to_column(var = "name"),
    by = "name"
    ) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "name", values_from = "value") %>%
  column_to_rownames(var = "plot.id")

sites <- sites_vltava %>%
  select(COVERE32)
```


### Calculation of the fourth-corner approach

```{r}
fc_ade4 <- ade4::fourthcorner(
  tabR = sites, tabL = species, tabQ = traits, modeltype = 6 # max test
  )
fc_ade4
```

The fourth corner statistic r = 0.212, and the p value of it (calculated by max test, since the argument `modeltype = 6`) is significant.

### Calculation with several traits

We can calculate the fourth corner for more than a single combination of trait and environmental variable. Let's use all three traits available in vltava$herbs$traits, namely SLA, plant height and seed weight, and also choose three environmental variables which may have some relationship to them, namely heat load (combination of slope and aspect, indicating radiation income of the site), soil depth, and cover of canopy layer. 

```{r}
traits <- traits_vltava %>%
  select(SLA_log, seed.weight_log, plant.height) %>%
  drop_na()

species <- species_vltava %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "plot.id") %>%
  pivot_longer(-plot.id, names_to = "name", values_to = "value") %>%
  semi_join(
    traits %>%
      rownames_to_column(var = "name"),
    by = "name"
    ) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "name", values_from = "value") %>%
  column_to_rownames(var = "plot.id")

sites <- sites_vltava %>%
  select(HEAT.LOAD, SOILDPT, COVERE32)

traits_fc_ade4 <- fourthcorner(tabR = sites, tabL = species, tabQ = traits)
traits_fc_ade4
```

Note that the function automatically applies correction of P-values for multiple testing by Holm's method (the last column, 'Pvalue.adj').

To plot the results, use: 

```{r}
plot(traits_fc_ade4)
# Plot also a scatterplot with line
```

Two of the relationships are significant: plant height and soil depth (red = positive) and SLA and heat load (blue = negative). SLA and cover didn't make it through the Holm's correction.
